[00:00:000.01 --> 00:00:006.57] [SPEAKER_04]  So in the private side of things or at least the Bangalore or whatever people who watch with wealth YouTube channel right
[00:00:007.15 --> 00:00:009.55] [SPEAKER_04]  They would be thinking about what you mean
[00:00:009.55 --> 00:00:015.21] [SPEAKER_04]  Loose like yes, is that a thought on the public services side carry a good?
[00:00:015.21 --> 00:00:020.21] [SPEAKER_04]  You know people have these fancy excel sheets saying you need to make some 20 to 20 to CR
[00:00:020.21 --> 00:00:020.97] [SPEAKER_04]  Do you
[00:00:007.24 --> 00:00:007.30] [SPEAKER_00]  Thank you.
[00:00:007.32 --> 00:00:007.32] [SPEAKER_01] 
[00:00:007.36 --> 00:00:007.38] [SPEAKER_00]  you
[00:00:010.11 --> 00:00:010.27] [SPEAKER_01]  Thank you.
[00:00:010.65 --> 00:00:010.93] [SPEAKER_00]  Yes.
[00:00:020.99 --> 00:00:022.25] [SPEAKER_01]  even think about this.
[00:00:022.65 --> 00:00:023.85] [SPEAKER_01]  Like we don't think about it.
[00:00:024.23 --> 00:00:027.99] [SPEAKER_01]  And in terms of financial insecurity I would say,
[00:00:029.25 --> 00:00:030.99] [SPEAKER_01]  Dharthohutaya, like you know I think
[00:00:031.87 --> 00:00:034.73] [SPEAKER_01]  Kalko got me the family there's a medical emergency
[00:00:034.73 --> 00:00:037.09] [SPEAKER_01]  and I need a huge amount of money.
[00:00:037.75 --> 00:00:040.23] [SPEAKER_01]  And when he got fired, what did you get the job?
[00:00:040.23 --> 00:00:041.19] [SPEAKER_01]  You know, I was free, I was free.
[00:00:041.93 --> 00:00:045.99] [SPEAKER_01]  Or tomorrow let's your kid gets admitted to a very prestigious school
[00:00:046.51 --> 00:00:050.09] [SPEAKER_01]  and you can't afford the fees because with this salary you can't.
[00:00:050.09 --> 00:00:055.17] [SPEAKER_01]  And in fact I know a officer who got admitted to Harvard but she couldn't afford the fees.
[00:00:055.53 --> 00:00:057.37] [SPEAKER_01]  So she just dropped it.
[00:00:057.97 --> 00:00:059.93] [SPEAKER_01]  So those are the things I think,
[00:01:000.37 --> 00:01:004.57] [SPEAKER_01]  as a couple of times I never went to the college.
[00:01:005.25 --> 00:01:006.45] [SPEAKER_01]  Do you question your choices?
[00:01:003.47 --> 00:01:003.95] [SPEAKER_00]  Mm-hmm.
[00:01:008.92 --> 00:01:012.76] [SPEAKER_03]  I just like to told you that needs for a foreign country,
[00:01:013.22 --> 00:01:016.76] [SPEAKER_03]  for foreign country, if you want to do foreign foreign,
[00:01:017.22 --> 00:01:018.92] [SPEAKER_03]  if your ambition is there,
[00:01:019.82 --> 00:01:021.92] [SPEAKER_03]  then private sector will be a better choice.
[00:01:022.82 --> 00:01:025.14] [SPEAKER_03]  I have to make peace with it.
[00:01:025.40 --> 00:01:026.34] [SPEAKER_03]  If I don't make peace,
[00:01:027.74 --> 00:01:030.36] [SPEAKER_03]  then I will go to the side track path,
[00:01:031.88 --> 00:01:033.90] [SPEAKER_03]  and I will be happy.
[00:01:034.25 --> 00:01:034.51] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah.
[00:01:034.61 --> 00:01:034.61] [SPEAKER_00] 
[00:01:034.64 --> 00:01:034.64] [SPEAKER_02] 
[00:01:037.61 --> 00:01:040.33] [SPEAKER_02]  I think I struggle with this question.
[00:01:041.77 --> 00:01:044.21] [SPEAKER_02]  I have understood the equation, which was typical equation,
[00:01:044.43 --> 00:01:049.61] [SPEAKER_02]  and for financial independence, basically you need around 25
[00:01:049.61 --> 00:01:052.17] [SPEAKER_02]  ex of your yearly spend.
[00:01:052.57 --> 00:01:057.51] [SPEAKER_02]  I think if I only go to very fundamental needs in Bangalore,
[00:01:057.99 --> 00:01:059.73] [SPEAKER_02]  with the lifestyle which we are living.
[00:02:000.09 --> 00:02:000.57] [SPEAKER_02]  I think,
[00:02:000.96 --> 00:02:002.92] [SPEAKER_04]  But the 25 X is not enough, no?
[00:02:003.20 --> 00:02:005.22] [SPEAKER_04]  If you just consider it like say
[00:02:005.22 --> 00:02:006.44] [SPEAKER_04]  the mixed in angle,
[00:02:006.56 --> 00:02:007.84] [SPEAKER_04]  2 lakh rupees per minute,
[00:02:008.26 --> 00:02:010.34] [SPEAKER_04]  the salt is like that,
[00:02:010.46 --> 00:02:012.08] [SPEAKER_04]  but it is into the salt and sugar.
[00:02:012.30 --> 00:02:015.68] [SPEAKER_04]  I don't think that is enough to have a comfortable life in Bangalore.
[00:02:016.10 --> 00:02:017.98] [SPEAKER_04]  Assuming that you are going to live up to 80 or 20.
[00:02:018.00 --> 00:02:020.78] [SPEAKER_02]  .
[00:02:020.30 --> 00:02:023.46] [SPEAKER_01]  But at the thing is your needs no.
[00:02:023.82 --> 00:02:023.88] [SPEAKER_01]  Yes.
[00:02:023.37 --> 00:02:024.89] [SPEAKER_02]  ...he turned from perpethält in high school
[00:02:025.12 --> 00:02:027.18] [SPEAKER_04]  you will need to own some of these assets.
[00:02:027.18 --> 00:02:027.94] [SPEAKER_04]  No, that's you, man.
[00:02:027.10 --> 00:02:031.60] [SPEAKER_02]  As you may have asked me, you are doing your research.
[00:02:032.53 --> 00:02:037.76] [SPEAKER_02]  So, I am saying that I am struggling to figure out what is that number.
[00:02:037.94 --> 00:02:038.99] [SPEAKER_02]  Number for me because
[00:02:030.74 --> 00:02:031.42] [SPEAKER_04]  Your G-Eиласьiggling coming up.
[00:02:040.11 --> 00:02:046.71] [SPEAKER_02]  just like everybody else, my life style, my definition of new dislash won't keep
[00:02:046.71 --> 00:02:047.05] [SPEAKER_02]  functioning.
[00:02:048.02 --> 00:02:049.80] [SPEAKER_04]  My name is Biscru.
[00:02:050.84 --> 00:02:053.96] [SPEAKER_04]  By the way, this number I have found is very cool.
[00:02:054.82 --> 00:02:058.52] [SPEAKER_02]  you are talking then you are talking about 80 lakh rupees and well explained.
[00:02:054.93 --> 00:02:055.63] [SPEAKER_04]  So you are talking
[00:02:059.23 --> 00:03:004.17] [SPEAKER_04]  No, not spec because people like if you look at a decent 2 3vH King Bangalore.
[00:03:004.29 --> 00:03:012.21] [SPEAKER_02]  You have the same luck in your map, but if you have the same luck, then you have to search for the same luck.
[00:03:013.45 --> 00:03:017.95] [SPEAKER_02]  4% of the corpus is what you can spend without thinking. If you are not burning the corpus.
[00:03:006.07 --> 00:03:006.79] [SPEAKER_04]  Yeah, my Jordan.
[00:03:017.46 --> 00:03:019.70] [SPEAKER_04] ��- the car is ideal
[00:03:020.66 --> 00:03:021.70] [SPEAKER_04]  if you of course
[00:03:022.04 --> 00:03:023.76] [SPEAKER_02]  and even though he's the only person in the post, all his best.
[00:03:024.86 --> 00:03:026.26] [SPEAKER_04]  I'm a man of the busy orcax ill.
[00:03:027.90 --> 00:03:033.90] [SPEAKER_04]  But the point I'm making is your needs or like what you think is your lifestyle is also influenced by
[00:03:034.64 --> 00:03:035.78] [SPEAKER_04]  appeal around you.
[00:03:035.78 --> 00:03:036.02] [SPEAKER_04]  Totally.
[00:03:037.20 --> 00:03:037.20] [SPEAKER_04] 
[00:03:038.36 --> 00:03:040.54] [SPEAKER_04]  So you call it a little poor deal right?
[00:03:040.98 --> 00:03:041.02] [SPEAKER_04]  Yes.
[00:03:035.71 --> 00:03:035.71] [SPEAKER_03] 
[00:03:035.76 --> 00:03:035.96] [SPEAKER_00]  Thank you.
[00:03:036.00 --> 00:03:036.18] [SPEAKER_03]  Thank you.
[00:03:042.61 --> 00:03:043.29] [SPEAKER_04]  share.
[00:03:043.45 --> 00:03:045.43] [SPEAKER_04]  Can you describe the timeline of your income, right?
[00:03:045.59 --> 00:03:047.09] [SPEAKER_04]  So, EY then prep.
[00:03:048.28 --> 00:03:056.16] [SPEAKER_03]  I passed out in 2015 from college. At that time I got like 7, 8 kind of package, CTC.
[00:03:056.98 --> 00:04:003.60] [SPEAKER_03]  Then after first increment I was around 11, 12. Then I did preparation for two years.
[00:04:003.94 --> 00:04:006.40] [SPEAKER_03]  So that was no earning and like burning my savings.
[00:04:007.34 --> 00:04:011.74] [SPEAKER_03]  And after that the regular the basic salary 56, 100.
[00:04:012.32 --> 00:04:017.10] [SPEAKER_03]  But in hand what I'm getting right now is comparable to what was I getting in.
[00:04:017.10 --> 00:04:018.38] [SPEAKER_03]  After my first increment.
[00:04:019.26 --> 00:04:019.34] [SPEAKER_04]  you
[00:04:020.02 --> 00:04:021.76] [SPEAKER_04]  You want to walk us through your trig line?
[00:04:021.79 --> 00:04:028.97] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah, so through classmates I got a CTC of around 16 lakhs then I was transferred to the Houston office
[00:04:028.97 --> 00:04:038.89] [SPEAKER_01]  Houston there the CTC I would say was about $150,000 salary plus the apartment and the vehicle then there to
[00:04:021.94 --> 00:04:021.94] [SPEAKER_04] 
[00:04:021.99 --> 00:04:022.05] [SPEAKER_03]  you
[00:04:022.13 --> 00:04:022.21] [SPEAKER_03]  Yeah.
[00:04:038.38 --> 00:04:039.76] [SPEAKER_04]  And then that would be about one year.
[00:04:040.33 --> 00:04:043.71] [SPEAKER_01]  Yeah, okay. Yeah after deduction, less in hand,
[00:04:043.99 --> 00:04:045.61] [SPEAKER_01]  the taxes and other things.
[00:04:046.55 --> 00:04:048.93] [SPEAKER_01]  And then of course I also started preparing.
[00:04:049.69 --> 00:04:052.95] [SPEAKER_01]  So it was zero income for about two years.
[00:04:053.63 --> 00:04:056.21] [SPEAKER_01]  And then I started again at 56,100.
[00:04:057.05 --> 00:05:000.51] [SPEAKER_01]  Today I stand at the basic salary of 59,500.
[00:05:001.05 --> 00:05:005.47] [SPEAKER_01]  My current salary, almost three times is other used to pay
[00:05:005.47 --> 00:05:008.59] [SPEAKER_01]  as tax in my last job in 2017, 2018.
[00:05:008.59 --> 00:05:011.07] [SPEAKER_01]  So that's the kind of pay cut we have taken.
[00:05:011.57 --> 00:05:011.65] [SPEAKER_01]  Still.
[00:05:011.91 --> 00:05:012.69] [SPEAKER_01]  Abhinav, why don't you go?
[00:05:007.70 --> 00:05:007.72] [SPEAKER_00]  you

[00:05:013.20 --> 00:05:019.46] [SPEAKER_02]  My first job was at McKenzie in Dubai office, so it started with 35 lakh rupees in Dubai.
[00:05:020.08 --> 00:05:025.38] [SPEAKER_02]  And then when I decided to come back to India for 6 month I was at 0 because I was just
[00:05:025.38 --> 00:05:028.12] [SPEAKER_02]  living on my savings to start my first company.
[00:05:029.22 --> 00:05:036.54] [SPEAKER_02]  Then I started drawing 6 lakh rupees salary from my first startup, then I shut down,
[00:05:036.88 --> 00:05:039.60] [SPEAKER_02]  then again 0 for 6-7 months.
[00:05:039.60 --> 00:05:047.24] [SPEAKER_02]  Second startup, I drew 15 lakh salary because I was married by then,
[00:05:047.44 --> 00:05:052.02] [SPEAKER_02]  fear then it was acquired by an academy and then I went to the market level salary.
[00:05:052.76 --> 00:05:058.50] [SPEAKER_02]  But then again for the last 8-9 months I am on 0 because I have left it for 2 work on my.
[00:05:013.20 --> 00:05:013.20] [SPEAKER_03]

[00:05:058.24 --> 00:06:000.42] [SPEAKER_04]  What is this market level number?
[00:06:001.33 --> 00:06:004.65] [SPEAKER_02]  I mean, I market level numbers, I cannot disclose, but it is.
[00:06:004.93 --> 00:06:005.59] [SPEAKER_04]  Goal, pan, goal, pan, goal.

[00:06:007.26 --> 00:06:014.62] [SPEAKER_04]  I got out of I'm being I was drawing I think 35k month I was at 35k for until the first liquidity
[00:06:014.62 --> 00:06:016.48] [SPEAKER_04]  They would be sold in the business
[00:06:017.74 --> 00:06:025.38] [SPEAKER_04]  Then I got married so in exile there was nothing because second business I think you were drawing something like 12 lakhs for 18 months

[00:06:035.29 --> 00:06:043.23] [SPEAKER_04]  Then when we started store I started 50k and by that time I was married now it is like 40
[00:06:043.77 --> 00:06:050.81] [SPEAKER_04]  Yeah, but this is still like I think 60% of market like I've some of my friends who graduated from Miami
[00:06:050.81 --> 00:06:052.41] [SPEAKER_04]  I'm being sorry
[00:06:052.41 --> 00:06:054.05] [SPEAKER_04]  They are in that 1890
[00:06:054.63 --> 00:06:057.73] [SPEAKER_04]  The lifestyle inflation is much more on the private side of the right
[00:06:047.14 --> 00:06:047.22] [SPEAKER_00]  Thank you.
[00:06:054.88 --> 00:06:054.94] [SPEAKER_03]  Thank you.
[00:06:057.77 --> 00:07:003.53] [SPEAKER_03]  So for us it is very difficult, when I come to Bangalore and I go out with people.
[00:07:004.09 --> 00:07:008.53] [SPEAKER_03]  So I would like spend 5% to 10% of my salary in just one day.
[00:07:009.73 --> 00:07:010.55] [SPEAKER_03]  Yeah, it's expensive.
[00:07:010.83 --> 00:07:014.15] [SPEAKER_03]  It's very expensive when you come out. When you are there,
[00:07:014.59 --> 00:07:016.71] [SPEAKER_03]  it's a good idea. I'm saying, come expenses. Come on.
[00:06:057.78 --> 00:06:058.44] [SPEAKER_04]  That's so far.
[00:06:058.48 --> 00:06:058.94] [SPEAKER_04]  What does it do?
[00:07:006.17 --> 00:07:006.17] [SPEAKER_02] 
[00:07:008.06 --> 00:07:008.08] [SPEAKER_02]  you
[00:07:009.37 --> 00:07:010.53] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, it's expensive.
[00:07:017.34 --> 00:07:020.30] [SPEAKER_04]  Is it fair to say most of your like basics?
[00:07:020.58 --> 00:07:023.12] [SPEAKER_04]  Alri is like kind of savings because
[00:07:023.12 --> 00:07:026.16] [SPEAKER_04]  She most of lifestyle expenses are the right way to get out of it.
[00:07:023.06 --> 00:07:024.98] [SPEAKER_03]  Once more like style expectations.
[00:07:026.42 --> 00:07:028.56] [SPEAKER_03]  Everyone they are waiting foravatam to get red
[00:07:033.85 --> 00:07:039.87] [SPEAKER_04]  My grandfather wanted me to be a IS officer and the reason is he was a Pune in
[00:07:040.44 --> 00:07:045.46] [SPEAKER_04]  Usma Ravad collector. So my mom actually grew up in collectors buffalo like you know
[00:07:045.46 --> 00:07:048.58] [SPEAKER_04]  God girl. I mean of course there is some perception of power
[00:07:048.58 --> 00:07:054.44] [SPEAKER_04]  Red, you know this seems like a more stable job, but when both of you have worked in sort of private markets
[00:07:054.44 --> 00:07:056.96] [SPEAKER_04]  So what was the motivation to sort of
[00:07:039.82 --> 00:07:040.12] [SPEAKER_00]  Thank you.
[00:07:040.26 --> 00:07:040.50] [SPEAKER_00]  No.
[00:07:041.54 --> 00:07:041.86] [SPEAKER_00]  Together.
[00:07:044.47 --> 00:07:045.07] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah.
[00:07:045.12 --> 00:07:045.82] [SPEAKER_03]  Good luck!
[00:07:045.88 --> 00:07:045.88] [SPEAKER_00] 
[00:07:048.75 --> 00:07:049.15] [SPEAKER_00]  Thank you.
[00:07:058.00 --> 00:08:000.87] [SPEAKER_01]  and me but dont mean speaking speaking now
[00:08:000.87 --> 00:08:004.88] [SPEAKER_01]  But it is dirty
[00:08:004.88 --> 00:08:005.75] [SPEAKER_01]  Okay
[00:08:007.88 --> 00:08:009.26] [SPEAKER_01]  Man
[00:08:009.26 --> 00:08:011.87] [SPEAKER_01]  Well so in that
[00:08:016.62 --> 00:08:021.90] [SPEAKER_01]  The next time you will feel
[00:08:021.90 --> 00:08:023.94] [SPEAKER_01]  the same thing
[00:08:023.94 --> 00:08:024.85] [SPEAKER_01]  Power is right.
[00:08:025.25 --> 00:08:025.44] [SPEAKER_01]  Power.
[00:08:025.96 --> 00:08:030.99] [SPEAKER_01]  And the other thing that is going on is that the money is going on.
[00:08:031.38 --> 00:08:032.00] [SPEAKER_01]  The money is going on.
[00:08:032.07 --> 00:08:033.14] [SPEAKER_01]  The money is going on.
[00:08:033.64 --> 00:08:037.02] [SPEAKER_01]  The respect and the prestige that comes from the job.
[00:08:037.78 --> 00:08:041.18] [SPEAKER_01]  A president of India that signs of your appointment is in.
[00:08:041.80 --> 00:08:044.50] [SPEAKER_01]  And we have protected by the constitution of India.
[00:08:044.90 --> 00:08:047.16] [SPEAKER_01]  Can no one can fire us below the president of India.
[00:08:006.19 --> 00:08:006.21] [SPEAKER_00]  you
[00:08:009.80 --> 00:08:010.26] [SPEAKER_00]  Thank you.
[00:08:023.93 --> 00:08:024.79] [SPEAKER_02]  words to you.
[00:08:029.02 --> 00:08:029.26] [SPEAKER_02]  Thank you.
[00:08:031.23 --> 00:08:032.15] [SPEAKER_00]  שא� to that, that.
[00:08:047.89 --> 00:08:050.55] [SPEAKER_01]  So that's the biggest job security we have.
[00:08:050.75 --> 00:08:051.57] [SPEAKER_01]  So we won't be able to get over the attention.
[00:08:052.39 --> 00:08:053.55] [SPEAKER_01]  We won't be able to get over it.
[00:08:054.07 --> 00:08:059.07] [SPEAKER_02]  I would like to add on that point what lavish was saying is that once you are an officer
[00:08:059.07 --> 00:09:001.65] [SPEAKER_02]  there is a prestige without any condition.
[00:09:002.71 --> 00:09:006.59] [SPEAKER_02]  In entrepreneurship there is glory to the successful people.
[00:09:007.07 --> 00:09:012.59] [SPEAKER_02]  I know personally you would know personally so many founders who nobody knows about but
[00:09:012.59 --> 00:09:017.77] [SPEAKER_02]  they are still struggling, struggling is struggling right and if they go to a typical
[00:09:020.16 --> 00:09:020.18] [SPEAKER_00]  you
[00:09:020.26 --> 00:09:020.30] [SPEAKER_00]  you
[00:09:024.49 --> 00:09:026.69] [SPEAKER_02]  which may be an officer will get.
[00:09:026.88 --> 00:09:030.92] [SPEAKER_04]  But what is the drop off let's say three years out after like you know actually
[00:09:030.92 --> 00:09:031.96] [SPEAKER_04]  Go both come
[00:09:027.02 --> 00:09:027.22] [SPEAKER_03]  Thank you.
[00:09:027.24 --> 00:09:027.32] [SPEAKER_02]  Thank you.
[00:09:027.46 --> 00:09:027.60] [SPEAKER_02]  Thank you.
[00:09:030.89 --> 00:09:033.13] [SPEAKER_03]  It is a very important thing.
[00:09:033.27 --> 00:09:036.15] [SPEAKER_03]  We understand that social pressure is also in that.
[00:09:037.17 --> 00:09:042.43] [SPEAKER_03]  When there is social prestige to it, social pressure is also you exit.
[00:09:043.01 --> 00:09:046.51] [SPEAKER_03]  If you exit, then you will say, I don't do so.
[00:09:032.23 --> 00:09:032.63] [SPEAKER_04]  health of bad luck.
[00:09:032.89 --> 00:09:033.23] [SPEAKER_04]  Thank you.
[00:09:036.46 --> 00:09:036.66] [SPEAKER_00]  Thank you.
[00:09:047.75 --> 00:09:050.21] [SPEAKER_01]  No tight look,
[00:09:050.77 --> 00:09:052.07] [SPEAKER_01]  just keeping your position on is listed in your video.
[00:09:052.13 --> 00:09:052.13] [SPEAKER_03] 
[00:09:054.20 --> 00:09:055.26] [SPEAKER_03]  I mean...
[00:09:055.26 --> 00:09:057.22] [SPEAKER_03]  What is your social pressure?
[00:09:057.76 --> 00:09:058.90] [SPEAKER_03]  What is your social pressure?
[00:09:059.12 --> 00:10:000.02] [SPEAKER_03]  Why are you being a little bit scared?
[00:10:000.34 --> 00:10:000.74] [SPEAKER_03]  I won't.
[00:10:000.28 --> 00:10:001.60] [SPEAKER_01]  I want to ask a question.
[00:10:001.86 --> 00:10:001.86] [SPEAKER_01] 
[00:10:002.18 --> 00:10:004.24] [SPEAKER_01]  The biggest differentiator is how much I am.
[00:10:004.50 --> 00:10:006.42] [SPEAKER_01]  Between civil services and startup,
[00:10:007.18 --> 00:10:008.94] [SPEAKER_01]  is stability or predictability.
[00:10:009.68 --> 00:10:011.36] [SPEAKER_01]  You have kind of a set career path,
[00:10:011.80 --> 00:10:011.88] [SPEAKER_01]  yes.
[00:10:012.34 --> 00:10:013.40] [SPEAKER_01]  Saladize, roles.
[00:10:013.96 --> 00:10:017.16] [SPEAKER_01]  You don't even know what happens six months down the line.
[00:10:017.44 --> 00:10:018.50] [SPEAKER_01]  The startup is not going to be ready.
[00:10:019.30 --> 00:10:022.20] [SPEAKER_01]  So what are your goals for the match?
[00:10:022.58 --> 00:10:023.40] [SPEAKER_01]  Not the match, the Saladize.
[00:10:023.96 --> 00:10:025.30] [SPEAKER_01]  So it's my goal.
[00:10:025.44 --> 00:10:026.96] [SPEAKER_01]  How do you think about the career path?
[00:10:027.34 --> 00:10:027.52] [SPEAKER_01]  Yes.
[00:10:001.49 --> 00:10:001.83] [SPEAKER_03]  Yes.
[00:10:024.54 --> 00:10:027.30] [SPEAKER_04]  You don't understand how do you think that's the message?
[00:10:027.58 --> 00:10:027.58] [SPEAKER_04] 
[00:10:028.66 --> 00:10:032.22] [SPEAKER_04]  And there was this property which was nice, you know, it was within my budget.
[00:10:032.48 --> 00:10:035.64] [SPEAKER_04]  But position was I think 2026 or something like that.
[00:10:035.80 --> 00:10:039.96] [SPEAKER_04]  So the only thing I was saying was, I don't know.
[00:10:040.32 --> 00:10:044.98] [SPEAKER_04]  But I don't know whether I'll be able to afford this EMI or whether I'll be in Bangalore.
[00:10:035.51 --> 00:10:037.15] [SPEAKER_00]  hello nobody was supposed to find me
[00:10:037.15 --> 00:10:038.55] [SPEAKER_00]  you are still thinking?
[00:10:038.99 --> 00:10:039.83] [SPEAKER_00]  I don't know
[00:10:040.01 --> 00:10:041.27] [SPEAKER_01]  but like you know whether there´s music
[00:10:045.71 --> 00:10:050.03] [SPEAKER_01]  What are the biggest insecurities you face currently in your life?
[00:10:052.09 --> 00:10:059.69] [SPEAKER_01]  So, I am from Dapur Rajasthan and Abmiri posting a Karnataka in basically around two years ago.
[00:10:059.95 --> 00:11:002.67] [SPEAKER_01]  My grandfather during COVID-19 phase 2.
[00:11:003.11 --> 00:11:004.79] [SPEAKER_01]  So, he was sick and admitted.
[00:11:005.67 --> 00:11:006.41] [SPEAKER_01]  He had a proper lockdown.
[00:11:006.93 --> 00:11:009.23] [SPEAKER_01]  I couldn't go and see him and he passed away.
[00:11:010.15 --> 00:11:015.57] [SPEAKER_01]  So, after that, he said that the government was going to die.
[00:11:016.45 --> 00:11:017.01] [SPEAKER_01]  He was going to die.
[00:11:017.19 --> 00:11:019.19] [SPEAKER_01]  He was going to die and he would have to go to the hospital.
[00:11:020.51 --> 00:11:024.91] [SPEAKER_01]  I don't see that in future, I have to take care of my family and family.
[00:11:025.49 --> 00:11:026.57] [SPEAKER_01]  So, the kidder is fixed.
[00:11:027.19 --> 00:11:028.13] [SPEAKER_01]  It is kind of fixed.
[00:11:029.51 --> 00:11:033.55] [SPEAKER_01]  So, we have to serve wherever we are, a lot to throw out our life.
[00:11:019.80 --> 00:11:019.80] [SPEAKER_00] 
[00:11:019.86 --> 00:11:020.01] [SPEAKER_04]  Thank you.
[00:11:034.17 --> 00:11:038.23] [SPEAKER_03]  In security, I feel is that I don't have any fear of this disease.
[00:11:039.47 --> 00:11:044.15] [SPEAKER_03]  And I feel that all the insecurity of the final end point is death.
[00:11:045.07 --> 00:11:045.57] [SPEAKER_03]  No, it's not possible.
[00:11:046.75 --> 00:11:048.05] [SPEAKER_03]  So, fear of being scared of death.
[00:11:048.75 --> 00:11:053.35] [SPEAKER_03]  If I were to tackle it, then I would be happy.
[00:11:053.37 --> 00:11:053.37] [SPEAKER_04] 
[00:11:054.00 --> 00:11:058.76] [SPEAKER_04]  I think there is something to lose. I think three years back when I started, so
[00:11:058.76 --> 00:12:001.88] [SPEAKER_04]  there was nothing to lose. It was much easier. You know,
[00:12:001.96 --> 00:12:005.42] [SPEAKER_04]  two, three million top line, which means there is some real value. I mean,
[00:12:005.44 --> 00:12:010.14] [SPEAKER_04]  if you have like this business doesn't become really big, there is some market
[00:12:010.14 --> 00:12:012.52] [SPEAKER_04]  value that public market will assign to good citizens.
[00:12:000.33 --> 00:12:000.33] [SPEAKER_00] 
[00:12:000.81 --> 00:12:000.89] [SPEAKER_00]  Thank you.
[00:12:005.17 --> 00:12:005.43] [SPEAKER_01]  Thank you.
[00:12:012.08 --> 00:12:018.58] [SPEAKER_01]  But also look at it like if you could build this from scratch yourself that should make you more confident
[00:12:018.58 --> 00:12:020.70] [SPEAKER_01]  Because he has a lot of stuff to cut out
[00:12:020.69 --> 00:12:023.29] [SPEAKER_04]  It's not that because again, like you don't know.
[00:12:024.27 --> 00:12:029.81] [SPEAKER_01]  But then again like you attribute your success to maybe luck or bespoke a girl T.
[00:12:030.45 --> 00:12:033.33] [SPEAKER_04]  No, not that. It's just that it is also matter of energy.
[00:12:034.03 --> 00:12:035.67] [SPEAKER_04]  See HVA part of the Laguna.
[00:12:034.00 --> 00:12:034.68] [SPEAKER_01]  He palm my hand.
[00:12:036.22 --> 00:12:041.22] [SPEAKER_04]  decided to start this business at just cross 30 or 31 right like when I have a 35
[00:12:041.22 --> 00:12:045.54] [SPEAKER_04]  over there. So would I or ambition be this?
[00:12:045.74 --> 00:12:050.52] [SPEAKER_04]  Yes. Energy, I mean your life circumstances change. I have a kid now.
[00:12:051.28 --> 00:12:057.20] [SPEAKER_04]  You know, why is it? I mean when I got married I like you know a wife approach to my decisions
[00:12:057.20 --> 00:12:059.40] [SPEAKER_04]  were very different. Yeah. So I'll do what I do.
[00:12:043.72 --> 00:12:043.72] [SPEAKER_00] 
[00:12:044.85 --> 00:12:045.09] [SPEAKER_01]  Thank you.
[00:12:045.73 --> 00:12:046.21] [SPEAKER_01]  Thank you.
[00:12:058.06 --> 00:12:058.18] [SPEAKER_03]  Thank you.
[00:12:058.32 --> 00:12:058.32] [SPEAKER_00] 
[00:13:000.62 --> 00:13:001.90] [SPEAKER_04]  But they didn't see the officer's in there.
[00:13:003.20 --> 00:13:006.78] [SPEAKER_04]  This is not like, like, the general uniform...
[00:13:006.78 --> 00:13:008.44] [SPEAKER_04]  But when the officers Stefanier falls in carelled...
[00:13:001.36 --> 00:13:001.36] [SPEAKER_00] 
[00:13:008.38 --> 00:13:012.92] [SPEAKER_03]  I feel, when family starts to do it, you start become little less ambitious.
[00:13:013.78 --> 00:13:020.90] [SPEAKER_03]  You start to feel that life is more about these small moments that happen as rather than
[00:13:020.90 --> 00:13:022.84] [SPEAKER_03]  I have to make a partner.
[00:13:024.61 --> 00:13:030.77] [SPEAKER_02]  I think for me, mine security is whether I will be able to go 10x from here.
[00:13:032.09 --> 00:13:035.47] [SPEAKER_02]  So, the insecurity is what if I don't get 10x from here?
[00:13:035.64 --> 00:13:035.95] [SPEAKER_00]  Mm.
[00:13:035.68 --> 00:13:035.98] [SPEAKER_02]  Mm-hmm.
[00:13:036.44 --> 00:13:041.80] [SPEAKER_02]  I know when I get 10X from here, I will have a still the same insecurity, how will I get 10X from here.
[00:13:041.69 --> 00:13:042.09] [SPEAKER_03]  Thank you.
[00:13:042.11 --> 00:13:045.17] [SPEAKER_02]  So, Abhito Yehert, please.
[00:13:045.79 --> 00:13:046.71] [SPEAKER_02]  I'm not sure.
[00:13:045.15 --> 00:13:045.49] [SPEAKER_03]  Thank you.
[00:13:047.02 --> 00:13:049.72] [SPEAKER_03]  you are saying that I draw this much salary, I draw that man.
[00:13:049.82 --> 00:13:055.90] [SPEAKER_03]  But there are always esophs, equity, when you get an exit, so you get a huge chunk of money.
[00:13:056.78 --> 00:14:000.66] [SPEAKER_03]  So, how do these things work out and can save an initial decision to save a revolt?
[00:14:000.94 --> 00:14:008.08] [SPEAKER_02]  So, I will tell you the basic math out of 100 startups more than 90 percent do not work out.
[00:14:008.50 --> 00:14:011.74] [SPEAKER_02]  So, right from the beginning you are against the probability.
[00:14:012.20 --> 00:14:012.28] [SPEAKER_00]  you
[00:14:012.50 --> 00:14:019.04] [SPEAKER_02]  But it's a risk-reward equation. So as a founder, most of your financial outcome is
[00:14:019.04 --> 00:14:025.52] [SPEAKER_02]  logged in terms of equity, relying on an assumption that if this works out, it will mathematically
[00:14:025.52 --> 00:14:028.16] [SPEAKER_02]  solve for me because then it will be 100x.
[00:14:028.36 --> 00:14:029.34] [SPEAKER_04]  you're needing to be with you.
[00:14:029.36 --> 00:14:029.92] [SPEAKER_02]  the right to watch.
[00:14:030.37 --> 00:14:034.97] [SPEAKER_02]  Exactly, but the probability of that one says 1 percent like that
[00:14:035.03 --> 00:14:037.81] [SPEAKER_04]  How do you invest your money?
[00:14:038.37 --> 00:14:041.51] [SPEAKER_04]  Like, whatever is largely savings,
[00:14:042.67 --> 00:14:044.41] [SPEAKER_04]  what are your preferred modes of investment?
[00:14:044.76 --> 00:14:050.00] [SPEAKER_03]  So mutual funds come from the top of the GB of sovereign gold bonds.
[00:14:051.28 --> 00:14:053.08] [SPEAKER_03]  They come from the top of the GB of sovereign gold bonds.
[00:14:053.42 --> 00:14:055.58] [SPEAKER_03]  And the PFF is investing.
[00:14:056.10 --> 00:14:058.28] [SPEAKER_03]  Because we are not allowed to do speculations.
[00:14:058.80 --> 00:15:001.80] [SPEAKER_03]  Whether you are trading, that is not allowed as per the conduct rules.
[00:15:002.20 --> 00:15:002.60] [SPEAKER_03]  That's right.
[00:15:002.78 --> 00:15:006.68] [SPEAKER_03]  So if you are investment, then it's a 50% of my salary.
[00:15:007.53 --> 00:15:014.99] [SPEAKER_01]  for you. So, in my current salary guys I invest about 60 percent which is my savings in
[00:15:015.65 --> 00:15:016.61] [SPEAKER_01]  SIP's industry.
[00:15:017.85 --> 00:15:018.33] [SPEAKER_04]  I've been on.
[00:15:018.53 --> 00:15:018.71] [SPEAKER_04]  Yes.
[00:15:018.43 --> 00:15:018.43] [SPEAKER_01] 
[00:15:018.46 --> 00:15:025.18] [SPEAKER_02]  So, I think of it as I generally invest in those instruments which can be, which can get
[00:15:025.18 --> 00:15:032.68] [SPEAKER_02]  liquid instantly because I think of the money as my startup investment capital.
[00:15:033.24 --> 00:15:037.24] [SPEAKER_02]  So most of the money is in mutual funds which can be redeemed overnight.
[00:15:038.34 --> 00:15:045.04] [SPEAKER_02]  Some of the money is I think in FDs almost 80-90% is in mutual funds.
[00:15:045.71 --> 00:15:053.67] [SPEAKER_04]  for me a lot is actually in every season which is financially not a certain reason but now I'm
[00:15:053.67 --> 00:16:000.71] [SPEAKER_04]  thinking about real estate also because have a kid now so you let them or you need one stable
[00:16:000.71 --> 00:16:007.85] [SPEAKER_04]  stability to make sure school schedule is not okay what's a drawback of your profession
[00:16:007.85 --> 00:16:008.77] [SPEAKER_04]  people don't realize.
[00:15:058.14 --> 00:16:001.30] [SPEAKER_00]  Yeah, so you need one stable stability.
[00:16:010.52 --> 00:16:016.54] [SPEAKER_03]  like generally because in the when you are in the field social circle is limited because
[00:16:017.12 --> 00:16:017.38] [SPEAKER_00]  Mm.
[00:16:017.41 --> 00:16:017.73] [SPEAKER_03]  you
[00:16:018.96 --> 00:16:022.75] [SPEAKER_03]  you generally try and hang out with other officers, other people.
[00:16:023.00 --> 00:16:027.68] [SPEAKER_01]  social life if you are doing so healthless people
[00:16:027.68 --> 00:16:028.68] [SPEAKER_01]  so I am still in the leg gone
[00:16:028.68 --> 00:16:030.12] [SPEAKER_01]  so Europe have friends
[00:16:030.12 --> 00:16:032.00] [SPEAKER_01]  People will handle it
[00:16:032.54 --> 00:16:033.92] [SPEAKER_01]  Second is this

[00:16:035.52 --> 00:16:035.52] [SPEAKER_01] 
[00:16:035.52 --> 00:16:036.74] [SPEAKER_01]  to take this example
[00:16:036.74 --> 00:16:038.16] [SPEAKER_01]  that if you are into a meeting
[00:16:038.16 --> 00:16:039.64] [SPEAKER_01]  What is this that you need to pick
[00:16:039.64 --> 00:16:040.20] [SPEAKER_01]  What seems to use,

[00:16:043.76 --> 00:16:044.64] [SPEAKER_01]  those are the things that work today
[00:16:030.53 --> 00:16:030.81] [SPEAKER_00]  Mmm.
[00:16:047.33 --> 00:16:053.25] [SPEAKER_01]  So that's like the kind of drivers say beyond even knows what you're doing.
[00:16:053.78 --> 00:16:056.76] [SPEAKER_01]  And third I said, I'll go to Guarzadur.

[00:17:011.05 --> 00:17:011.87] [SPEAKER_02]  not be any recognition.
[00:17:012.59 --> 00:17:012.87] [SPEAKER_04]  Yes.
[00:17:012.62 --> 00:17:013.46] [SPEAKER_02]  Yeah, so
[00:17:013.91 --> 00:17:018.69] [SPEAKER_04]  Well, a lot of entrepreneurs are like overnight successes after being at it for take.
[00:17:019.29 --> 00:17:019.29] [SPEAKER_04] 
[00:17:019.99 --> 00:17:019.99] [SPEAKER_04] 
[00:17:021.03 --> 00:17:026.07] [SPEAKER_04]  Is that I think people don't realize the toll it takes on your mental health.

[00:17:030.15 --> 00:17:030.15] [SPEAKER_02] 
[00:17:030.15 --> 00:17:030.15] [SPEAKER_02] 
[00:17:030.15 --> 00:17:030.15] [SPEAKER_02] 
[00:17:030.15 --> 00:17:030.15] [SPEAKER_02]

[00:17:043.19 --> 00:17:043.59] [SPEAKER_04]  Not so far.
